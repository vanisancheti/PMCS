# PMCS

This repository consists of the following 3 folders:
* Experiments : Consists of all the executables for the codes.
* Naive: Consists of code for the Naive Iterative Approach.
* PMCS: Consists of code for the PMCS Approach.

For generating synthetic datasets we have used the tool provided by: M. Kuromochi and G. Karypis. Frequent subgraph discovery. pages 313-320,  ICDM 2001.
The node and edge labels are generated as labels. 
We have attached the publicly available executable for the tool: ggen-i386-Linux

We have provided a script "convert.pl" which takes as input the data generated by the above tool and prints on stdout the new data file with the node and edge labels mapped to integers.

The following command converts the old_file.txt which has string labels for nodes and edges into new_file.txt with integer labels for nodes and edges.
$ perl convert.pl <old_file.txt> new_file.txt
