This folder contains the script (automateTest_1.sh) to compute Maximal Frequent Subgraphs using PMCS.

We have divided the script into 3 steps::
1. Generating Synthetic Data
2. Performing Local Computation
    2a. Using gSpan
    2b. Using MARGIN
3. Performing Global Computation
    3a. Using Naive Iterative Approach
    3b. Using PMCS Approach

How to run?
    - Update the following Parameters in the script:
        -index              - Specify the databases size as the value of index in the for loop
        -graph parameters   - Specify the graph parameters (L, T, i, E, V) that would be used by the graph generater. 
        -support            - specifies the support value
        -partition          - specifies the number of partition
    
    - For using gSpan as Local Computation method, update the file name after flag -g at line 82 and line 107 to be local_gSpan.txt, and uncomment the corresponding code in the script from Line 27-53.

    - For using MARGIN as Local Computation method, update the file name after flag -g at line 82 and line 107 to be local_margin.txt, and uncomment the corresponding code in the script from Line 56-77

    - Running the script:
        ./automateTest_1.sh
